# Tweet-Tree

## Overview
Tweet-tree is a project to expand upon the Adafruit [Christmahanukwanzaa tree](https://learn.adafruit.com/wifi-controlled-led-christmahanukwanzaa-tree/) project by making the tree Tweet reactive.

It is completely conceptual at this point in time, but will be commiting code and notes as I go.
